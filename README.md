# Adaptive Bitrate Algorithms Cloud Final Project 2020
## Will Ye, Simon Zeng, Jason Zhang

- We aim to investigate how adaptive bitrate algorithms work in video streaming systems.
- Based on Pensieve https://github.com/hongzimao/pensieve
- Look under `/rl` for the reinforcement learning component
- Look under `/videoPlayer` for our custom video player system
